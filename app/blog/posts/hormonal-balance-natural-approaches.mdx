Hormonal balance is fundamental to women's health and well-being. From menstrual cycles to menopause, understanding how to support your hormones naturally can make a significant difference in your quality of life.

- **Magnesium**: Helps with PMS symptoms and sleep quality

**Foods to Include:**
- Leafy green vegetables
- Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel)
- Nuts and seeds
