#### Story Section - "You're Not Alone in This Journey"
**Main Story**: "Every morning, you look in the mirror and barely recognize the woman staring back. Your body feels like it's betraying you at every turn. The scale won't budge no matter how little you eat. Your periods arrive like unwelcome surprises—or disappear for months, leaving you wondering what's wrong now."

**Common Phrases Women Hear**:
- "Have you tried just eating less?"
- "Maybe you need to exercise more"
- "It's probably just stress"
- "This is normal for women your age"

**The Invisible Struggle** - What others don't see:
- The exhaustion that hits you like a wall at 3 PM
- The hair growing where it shouldn't and falling out where you want it
- The skin breakouts that make you feel like a teenager again
- The crushing disappointment every time your period doesn't come
- The shame when someone suggests 'lifestyle changes' as if you haven't tried everything

**Key Message**: "You're not broken. You're not lazy. You're not making it up."

**Dr. Salma's Understanding**: "After 20+ years as a gynecologist, Dr. Salma witnessed countless women like you walk through her office doors. She saw the pain in their eyes when they were handed another prescription without real answers. She felt their frustration when they were dismissed or misunderstood. That's why she made a life-changing decision. She left conventional medicine to become a naturopath—not because she stopped believing in medical expertise, but because she knew women deserved so much more."
